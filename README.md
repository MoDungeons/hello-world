My first repository of many!!! HAHA

Hello There!

MoDungeons here, working on my GitHub. I've been working in IT for quite some time in a support capacity doing everything from sysadmin to server support and now currently in a SAS CRM senior support role where we deal mostly with web application integration.

I am not a programmer or developer, but I want to be and I am starting with Python as I love Monty Python and think it would be a good language to get under my belt.

Thanks for reading and I look forward to learning!
